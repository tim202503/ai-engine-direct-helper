"""Deeper CPU-only smoke tests for the qai_appbuilder wheel.

Goes beyond `test_package_smoke.py` (which only checks Python-level imports
and constants) by exercising the pybind11 native extension and the QNN
backend DLL discovery path. None of these tests require a Snapdragon NPU
or a precompiled .bin model — they run on any ARM64 Windows host that
has the wheel installed, including GitHub-hosted windows-11-arm runners.

What is covered:
- pybind C++ extension loads and exposes set_log_level / set_profiling_level
- QNNConfig.Config(runtime=CPU) finds bundled QnnCpu.dll + QnnSystem.dll
- That same call routes through the pybind layer into native code
  (set_log_level + set_profiling_level are invoked at the end of Config())

What is NOT covered (and cannot be on a non-NPU runner):
- Loading a .bin context binary (HTP-compiled, fails on CPU runtime)
- Any actual inference
- HTP-only paths: PerfProfile, device infrastructure
